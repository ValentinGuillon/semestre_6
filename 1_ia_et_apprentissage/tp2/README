The file "tp1.py" is the only program to execute.

It contains some global values that allow comportement changements:

K
DATAS_SRC #to switch between IRIS and RANDOM datas
WITH_GRAPH #"True" to execute the algo one time, then show the results. "False" (always "iris" datas) to find the K offering the best purity of the clusters, between 1 and K
